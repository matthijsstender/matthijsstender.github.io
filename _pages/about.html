Welcome, my name is Matthijs Stender. I am currently in my 2nd year of studying game development at Alfa-College Groningen.

In my 2 years at this education, I've found Unity3D to be my strongest point.

I also feel like I'm great at working in a team. Occasionally I do run into problems but I feel like I'm fully capable of finding solutions for these problems.
